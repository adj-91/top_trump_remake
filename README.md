This is a remake of my original version of the app using React

In this game, each player is given 3 cards upon starting - these are generated by a function
which fetches a random pokemon from the pokeapi and stores data on its sprite, name, base
attack and base special attack. These values are then used by the PlayerCard component
to dynamically generate cards for the player to pick from.

The opponent is controlled by a simple AI which will choose a random card from their own hand. Each turn the player must choose either the attack or special stat, which will be compared against the opponent's card. The winner of the round will be the player who had
the highest stat out of the two - and will receive their opponent's card. If it is a draw,
both cards chosen by the players will be put into "limbo", where they will remain until
a player wins a round.

To win a player simply has to get all of their opponent's cards.


One feature I wanted to add that at the time I couldn't get working was for the AI to get
its own turns where it would choose a stat against the player.
